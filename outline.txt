Introduction ---> background info
	*setting up your science question:
		- bimodal galaxy population:
			- Red Sequence/Blue Cloud (color/stellar population)
			- Elliptical/Disc (morphology)
		These often go together, but not always
		2 different ?????????????:
			(1) ???????? of SF
			(2) morphological ?????? ??????????
			How are these ?????? related?
		--> Bundy et al Red Disc paper:
			- Red disc = evolutionary phase?
	*Previous work/ Context
		- What is the Fundamental Plane?
		- What do we already know about stellar pops/ ????????
		- What do we already know about morphology?/ merging?
	*More specific: Graves thesis paper
		- What are we adding? Why is it interesting?

Data
	- Data set we are using: SDSS, ????????????????Get this from Genevieve
	- Cuts:	
		- 0.025 < z < 0.1
			- 0.025 because we later use OII line and it is just in range of the SDSS spectrograph.
			- 0.1 because ?????? (I think because we don't want too big a difference in cosmological age of the galaxy samples.
		- H\alpha and OII EW cuts.---> ??????
		- quality cuts: Vdisp, etc.
	----> Figure 1. Color/Magnitude Diagram of final sample ---> ??????
	----> all values are R-band, unless otherwise noted.

Morphological Classification
	- ????? Gim2D parameters (B/T, s2)
	- ????? SDSS parameters (concentration, a/b)
	- Cheng et al classification ---> Disc/Intermediate/Bulge
	----> Figure 2 & 3: SDSS Thumbnails of disc and bulges (????)

The Fundamental Plane
	- what is the FP?
	- Why is it a good parameter space? (Graves thesis)
	---> Figure 4: edge on FP
	---> Figure 5: B/I/D in FP space
		B/I/D fall in slightly different parts of space.

Results!/ Stellar pop. analysis
	- Binning, stack spectra
	- disc indices/stellar pop. analysis
	---> Figure 6: Age Map
		       [Fe/H] Map
		       [Mg/Fe] Map
		- Existing trends are there: (Graves, Spingob???)
	-- Compare D vs. B:
		-- SAME trends!
		- Figure 7: Delta maps:
			- SAME values (Age, Fe, Mg)
				- Same star formation histories in the central bugle component of both types morphological galaxies!
					----> Figure 8: quantify this with the histograms

Discussion
	- go back to red disc as evolutionary phase model
	- talk to Kevin and Phil
		-
		-
		-

Conclusion
	- Brief recap
	- Bullet list of results
